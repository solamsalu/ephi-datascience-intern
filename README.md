## Part I: Overview

### 1. Objective of the Data Challenge
The objective of this data challenge is to explore the internâ€™s analytical skill and to imagine their problem-solving skill by providing them with real-world problems organizations face on a daily basis. In doing so, a data science modeling challenge that assesses students' mathematical, programming, and problem conceptualization skills has been prepared.

### 2. Description of the CHAMPS Dataset
In this data challenge, the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) dataset has been provided to the interns. The purpose of the CHAMPS Surveillance dataset was to collect, analyze, and share data to help identify the causes of child deaths in areas with high child mortality. For the child mortality dataset, there are underlying causes of death from the infant side and also maternal factors contributing to this death. For ease of understanding, variable names and their possible values have been decoded in Table 1 below (not shown here).

### 3. Dataset Name
The dataset used in this challenge is named `Champs.csv`.
